This crate provides a Bevy plugin for drawing outlines around meshes using the
vertex extrusion method.

## Dependency

```toml
[dependencies]
bevy_mod_outline = "0.5"
```

## Examples

A rotating cube and torus with opaque and transparent outlines.

```shell
cargo run --example shapes
```

Multiple intersecting meshes sharing an outline plane. The outline stencil is offset to create
a gap between the object and its outline.

```shell
cargo run --example pieces
```

Many instances of the same mesh, with two different outline configurations, flying towards the
camera.

```shell
cargo run --example flying_objects
```

An outlined torus viewed through four cameras with different combinations of render layers
enabled.

```shell
cargo run --example render_layers
```

An animated jointed glTF model with an outline.

```shell
cargo run --example animated_fox
```

A glTF model with pre-baked outline normals.

```shell
cargo run --example hollow
```

An animated morphing glTF model with an outline.

```shell
cargo run --example morph_targets
```

UI. This adds a dependency on the `bevy_ui` crate and can be disabled if it is
not used.
