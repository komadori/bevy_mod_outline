This crate provides a Bevy plugin for drawing outlines around meshes using the
vertex extrusion and jump flood methods.

## Dependency

```toml
[dependencies]
bevy_mod_outline = "0.11"
```

## Examples

A rotating cube and torus with opaque and transparent outlines.

```shell
cargo run --example shapes
```

Multiple intersecting meshes sharing an outline plane. The outline stencil is offset to create
a gap between the object and its outline.

```shell
cargo run --example pieces
```

Many instances of the same mesh, with two different outline configurations, flying towards the
camera.

```shell
cargo run --example flying_objects
```

An outlined torus viewed through four cameras with different combinations of render layers
enabled.

```shell
cargo run --example render_layers
```

An animated jointed glTF model with an outline.

```shell
cargo run --example animated_fox
```

A glTF model with pre-baked outline normals.

```shell
cargo run --example hollow
```

An animated morphing glTF model with an outline.

```shell
cargo run --example morph_targets
```

A pair of spheres, one outlined, with a UI for selecting different anti-aliasing modes.

```shell
cargo run --example ui_aa
```

An outlined non-manifold shape, with a UI for selecting different outlining methods and shapes.

```shell
cargo run --example ui_mode
```

An emissive sphere orbits another sphere, with outlines and HDR bloom post-processing.

```shell
cargo run --example bloom
```

A flat square with a pulsing jump-flood outline masked by a checkerboard alpha pattern.

```shell
cargo run --example alpha_mask
```

A set of shapes which can be selected by (shift-)clicking on them.

```shell
cargo run --example picking
```
